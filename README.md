# Chapter5_Program4_ShippingCost
A large Internet merchandise provider determines its shipping charges based on the total purchases. As the total increases, the shipping charges proportionally decrease. This is done to encourage more purchases. The following chart is used to determine the charges for shipping: 
	$0-$250.00: $5.00charge; 
	$250.01-$500.00: $8.00charge; 
	$500.01-$1000.00: $10.00charge; 
	$1000.01-$5000.00: $15.00charge; 
	Over $5000.00: $20.00charge.
Write a program that allows users to enter their total purchases and to determine their shipping charges. Your program should calculate and display their shipping charges. You must itemize the display so that it includes the cost of the purchases, the cost of the shipping, and the total cost (purchases + shipping).
